# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve these teaching materials — small, focused contributions are welcome.

- To add an article: add a Markdown file to `articles/` and a runnable example to `examples/`.
- Add tests for any code you include and update `docs/` when adding new pages.
- Use the exercise template `articles/02-exercise-template.md` for new assignments.

Workflow
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch `feat/<short-desc>` or `exercise/<your-name>`
3. Open a PR and reference the issue (if any)

Grading: include tests and a short README explaining how to run your solution.
