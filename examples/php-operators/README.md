[![CI](https://github.com/kamrankhalid786/medium-articles/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?query=branch:main)](https://github.com/kamrankhalid786/medium-articles/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

# PHP operators — examples

This folder contains minimal, focused examples that demonstrate a handful of useful PHP operators and expressions.

Quick start

```bash
cd examples/php-operators
composer install
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

What's included

- `src/Operators.php` — tiny functions showing each operator
- `tests/OperatorsTest.php` — PHPUnit assertions you can run in a classroom or locally

Notes

- Examples target PHP 8+ (uses `nullsafe` and `match`).
- Files are intentionally small so they can be copy/pasted into other projects.
