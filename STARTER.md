# starter branch — student scaffold

This branch is a student-ready scaffold: solutions have been removed and replaced with stubs.

What students should do
- Fork the repo and checkout the `starter` branch.
- Run the tests for an example (they will fail): `pytest examples/intro-python/tests` or `npm test` in `examples/intro-js` or `composer install && vendor/bin/phpunit -c examples/php-exception-handling/phpunit.xml`.
- Implement the functions/classes in `examples/*/*` until tests pass.

Instructor notes
- Use this branch as the assignment starting point (or create classroom assignments from it).
- The `main` branch retains full solutions and CI; `starter` intentionally contains failing tests to drive TDD.
